      "The portfolio experienced losses across all tenors. The short term (tenor < 2y) suffered the most significant loss of 1.82m EUR, driven by an 8.6 widening in the 1y node impacting a long risk position. This single factor was the primary driver of overall portfolio P&L in the short term. The mid-term (2y < tenor < 10y) incurred a loss of 0.92m EUR, stemming from a 1.2 tightening in the 2y node, also impacting a long risk position. Interestingly, while both short and long term losses were driven by widening spreads, the mid-term loss was caused by tightening. The long term (tenor > 10y) experienced a smaller loss of 0.18m EUR, attributed to an 8.6 widening in the 10y node affecting a long risk position. The consistent long risk positioning across all tenors suggests a potential vulnerability to adverse movements in interest rate spreads, particularly widenings in the short and long end of the curve.\n",

      "Driven by -0.98m IRDelta Loss to PL on USD Curve on Portfolio Hedging Rates Macro\n",
      "Profit and loss movements were concentrated in the short-term and mid-term tenors, both driven by EUR losses on short risk positions. The mid-term saw a loss of 1,143,114 EUR attributed to market changes in the 2Y node, while the short-term experienced a 123,123 EUR loss due to market volatility in the 1Y node. The magnitude of the mid-term loss significantly outweighs the short-term loss, suggesting a greater sensitivity of positions to the 2Y node compared to the 1Y node. No significant P&L movements were observed in the long-term.\n"
